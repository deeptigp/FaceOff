FaceOff
=======

This was a face detection algorithm written to improve the user experience of the profiles at LinkedIn. This was later
integrated with the main stack to be included into the Editing Profile Pictures module of the code. It would execute
on the profile pictures uploaded by LinkedIn users and upon uploading pictures which are not professional pictures, it would
suggest the user to upload a head shot.


I built this as part of a hackday.
